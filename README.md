# Laravel-like-Facebook

Laravel-like-Facebook is a real-time messaging system developed with Laravel 10 and Livewire 2. Inspired by WhatsApp, it provides an interactive chat experience based on the Livewire library, enabling dynamic interfaces without the need for page reloads.

This project is a replica of the Laravel and Livewire social network application created by [Arjaykun]
(https://github.com/arjaykun).
